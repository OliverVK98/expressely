There are some options, for example, we could use shared volume on our cluster and just replace the files there but appRenderer server is already running and all the variables inside that server are already initialised, so, without the rude hacks it's not possible to replace header component on a server without a restart or redeploy of the main application (appRenderer server) - so it's not an independent deployment anymore."

            "2 words on the magic 🪄 there. Once server sees import FragmentHeader from 'fragmentHeader/Fragment'; in appRenderer server code it just uses the default module federation server feature looking for the server version of header fragment in filesystem but the issue, as highlighted above, is that we can't use header code there since that would be the same filesystem and our inability to independently deploy header later since we won't be able to replace the header code without app restart or rude hacks. But we, instead, could use the plugin that will generate a file with the component, essentially just a wrapper, and the responsibility of that component would be just to derive the exact header code & components from the proper url. So, frankly speaking, we, actually, use the default ModuleFederation server support that looks for the header fragment in the filesystem but we use it not for delivering the exact header code but for delivery of the wrapper fragment - code that would know from where to fetch that header code from. Such file is being generated during the build phase and since the responsibility of that file is not changed time over time we could generate it once and just update the fragment's server that delivers the proper html now.",
            "🙋🏻‍♀️ All good so far, but how our server rendering phase would stop and wait once we go to the other server for header's html content? React usual standard methods like renderToString & renderToStaticMarkup do not support it and is considered as one-go operation like rendered and then sent to the browser.",
            "🤯 Standard methods don't support it but we'll use the new methods that react v18 brought to us. Essentially, that wrapper code that was generated is just a react component that uses new react v18 feature of React.Suspense. React.Suspense started supporting server-side rendering and that Suspense is being resolved once the call to other server is done and html is translated back to react component that is rendered again to html on appRenderer during the content is served back to the user's browser. If you're interested in the details, just look to the modules folder, all magic is in these 2 files:"

Each block is connected to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be modified, ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain is immutable and tamper-proof.",

These features include transparency, security, decentralization, immutability, and consensus. Transactions on the blockchain are transparent, meaning that anyone can view the transactions on the blockchain, but the identity of the sender and receiver is anonymous. The security of the blockchain is ensured through the use of cryptographic algorithms that protect the data stored on the blockchain from being tampered with or hacked.",
            "Decentralization is one of the most significant advantages of blockchain technology. The blockchain is not controlled by a single entity or authority, but by a network of nodes that work together to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Immutability ensures that once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be modified or deleted, making the data on the blockchain trustworthy and reliable.",
            "Consensus in blockchain is another critical feature. It ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, making it difficult for malicious actors to manipulate the data on the blockchain. Different consensus algorithms are used in blockchain technology, such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake."

Microsoft and its partner OpenAI are ahead in the race since it reached the pole first. Currently, ChatGPT and Bing are the best at accomplishing verbal tasks. Google Bard is the best for finding answers related to the latest affairs in the world. Amazon Bedrock has a great combination of AI models for creating custom generative AI applications. Amazon and Google tools are not yet available to the general public, but what they build may be a game changer.",
